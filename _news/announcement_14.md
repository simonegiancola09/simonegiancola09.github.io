Thrilled to make a meta-update! This month, I have graduated from Bocconi university with a MS in data science! Thanks to my awesome supervisor [Carlo Lucibello](https://carlolucibello.github.io/) for 5 years of mentorship. Since February I am also interning at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/) in Prof. [Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/)'s group, focusing on optimization!

I always like to find tools that can help me. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things I found around for research. 

<!-- There are websites, packages, and a doc I wrote down to summarize many useful tips about writing research works, which made me recently realize that most of my older documents are wrong ðŸ˜•. Whatever, now I know, we are made for mistakes.  -->

<!-- I am also adding my new LaTeX template. It is basically a personalization of a very standard one, included below. -->

Any suggestion is welcome!

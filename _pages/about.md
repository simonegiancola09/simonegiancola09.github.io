I am a PhD candidate (doctorant) in statistics at the [Orsay Institute, Paris-Saclay University](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/), supervised by [Christophe Giraud](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~christophe.giraud/) and [Nicolas Verzelen](https://verzelen.montpellier.inrae.fr/).


- 🛠 I like statistical-to-computational gaps, and reading about methods from physics and probability mixing up.

#### previously

I graduated with an [M2 in probability and statistics](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/etudiants/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m2/mathematiques-de-laleatoire/), Université Paris-Saclay, @[Institut de Mathématique d’Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/). The thesis was under the supervision of [Alexandra Carpentier](https://sites.google.com/site/alexandracarpentierresearch/) and my current supervisors. 


In 2024, I was a research intern @[KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/) in [Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/)'s group.

In the past, I was a research intern @[ENS Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en) under the supervision of [Bruno Loureiro](https://brloureiro.github.io/) and @[IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/home) under the supervision of [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/).


I also hold an MS in data science from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/master+of+science/data+science+and+business+analytics/). My supervisor was Prof. [Carlo Lucibello](https://carlolucibello.github.io/). Before my graduate studies, I completed a bachelor in economics and computer science.

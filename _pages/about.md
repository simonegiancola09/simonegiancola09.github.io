(from nov '25) I am a PhD student in statistics at the [Orsay Institute, Paris-Saclay University](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/), supervised by [Christophe Giraud](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~christophe.giraud/) and [Nicolas Verzelen](https://verzelen.montpellier.inrae.fr/).


- 📝 Give a look at my **[publication(s)](https://simonegiancola09.github.io/publications/)** page.
- 🛠 I like statistical-to-computational gaps, and reading about methods from physics and probability mixing up.

- 👨‍💻 Some notes are in my **[writings](https://simonegiancola09.github.io/projects/)** window.

#### other
- 🌊 Check this [blog post](https://simonegiancola09.github.io/blog/2023/list-of-interesting-things/) if you want to read about what I like outside of research.
- 🎨 The prompt I gave to Dall-E2 for the surprisingly self resembling image was
>"Van Gogh style painting of an Italian boy in his 20s with a shirt and eyeglasses, brown curly hair, brown eyes"

Perhaps I am an approximate ground state of some Open AI's ML model...

#### previously

In 2024, I was a research intern @[KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/) in Prof. [Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/)'s group, focusing on optimization. 

In 2023, I was a research intern @[ENS Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en) under the supervision of [Bruno Loureiro](https://brloureiro.github.io/), exploring stochastic gradient descent dynamics beyond the unstructured assumption. Before in the same year, I was a research intern @[IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/home) under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/), where I worked on approximate message passing and information theoretic limits of a model of inference. 

I graduated with an [M2 in probability and statistics](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/etudiants/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m2/mathematiques-de-laleatoire/), Université Paris-Saclay, [Institut de Mathématique d’Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/). Supervisor(s) were my current advisor(s). 
I also hold an MS in data science from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/master+of+science/data+science+and+business+analytics/). My supervisor was Prof. [Carlo Lucibello](https://carlolucibello.github.io/). Before my graduate studies, I completed a bachelor in economics and computer science.

Usually in physics, things happens gradually. This fact is sewn into the heart of classical physics where the positions and momenta of particles are described by smooth, differentiable functions. Indeed, historically, the idea that change happens only infinitesimally resulted in the discovery of calculus. Yet, somehow, what holds on the micro level fails at the macro.

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. \n Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will! \n Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!

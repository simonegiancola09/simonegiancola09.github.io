  abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

  abstract = {We contribute to the growing body of knowledge on more powerful and adaptive stepsizes for convex optimization, empowered by local curvature information. We do not go the route of fully-fledged second-order methods which require the expensive computation of the Hessian. Instead, our key observation is that, for some problems (e.g., when minimizing the sum of squares of absolutely convex functions), certain local curvature information is readily available, and can be used to obtain surprisingly powerful matrix-valued stepsizes, and meaningful theory. In particular, we develop three new methods--LCD1, LCD2 and LCD3--where the abbreviation stands for local curvature descent. While LCD1 generalizes gradient descent with fixed stepsize, LCD2 generalizes gradient descent with Polyak stepsize. Our methods enhance these classical gradient descent baselines with local curvature information, and our theory recovers the known rates in the special case when no curvature information is used. Our last method, LCD3, is a variable metric version of LCD2; this feature leads to a closed-form expression for the iterates. Our empirical results are encouraging, and show that the local curvature descent improves upon gradient descent.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

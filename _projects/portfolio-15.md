Dall-E2. The exact prompt was "A conceptual visualization of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Markov Chains in a simple, mathematical style". 
## Synopsis
In this short lecture, we will review the paper in the title. After presenting the framework, we will prove the
starting statement, and just briefly comment the other ones, which have very long proofs. To conclude, we will
overview the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation method, which is one direct application of the results, and
the ideas behind the deeper theorems.
Emphasis is on intuition and quick understanding. References are to a minimum. Computations, when
performed, are explicit. Throughout, we omit the full expressions of the theorems, but specify when these are
available in the original publication.

ChatGPT, quite hallucinatory. The exact prompt was "A nice application of kernel methods for random graphs". 
## Synopsis

In this short document we summarize the first part of a thesis about kernel methods in random graphs (Araya Valdivia 2020a). Emphasis is on intuition, proofs are sketched, computations are sometimes explicit, especially in tedious parts. References are to a minimum: for related work and context, we reroute the reader to the original papers (Araya Valdivia 2020b; Araya Valdivia and Yohann 2019) and the thesis (Araya Valdivia 2020a).
